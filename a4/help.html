        To Play: There are five rounds numbered 2 - 7. In each round the player
        tries to roll and score the number of the round, the numbers being the
        combinations possible with 2 dice. If a player throws the correct number
        for that round they score 1 point. If they throw any other number they
        donâ€™t score. The first person to get 5 points (round 7) wins.
